    <p class="fade"><strong>Hi, I’m Martin Raphael Dayola! Right now, I’m taking a one-year break from school to focus on building my skills and gaining hands-on experience. It’s a chance for me to step outside the classroom and explore my passions in a more personal and meaningful way.  

      During this break, I’ve been working as a photographer at memoir studio. For me, photography isn’t just about taking pictures—it’s about capturing emotions, telling stories, and preserving moments that people can cherish forever. Every photo I take reflects a piece of my creativity and the connection I share with the people or places I’m photographing. It’s an art form that challenges me to see the world differently and continuously improve my craft.  
      
      This time away from studying has been more than just work, though. It’s also a period of self-discovery. I’m learning more about what drives me, what inspires me, and what I want to achieve in the future. I’ve been setting goals, exploring new opportunities, and preparing myself for the next chapter in my education and my life.  
      
      This journey has taught me the value of following your passions, stepping out of your comfort zone, and embracing every experience as a chance to grow. I’m excited to see where this path takes me, and I can’t wait to capture more moments and tell more stories along the way.   </strong>
